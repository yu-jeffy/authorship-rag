Chapter 00

“That’s him! I see him! That’s the motherfucker!” Celine muttered into the radio, trying to scream quietly from her hiding spot. 

The dry Arizona heat radiated from the pavement in shimmering waves, distorting the air like a mirage. Celine's dark hair clung to the back of her neck, dampened by a thin sheen of sweat. Despite the oppressive warmth, she felt a chill run down her spine as the adrenaline coursed through her veins, heightening her senses. This was the moment she had been waiting for, the culmination of months of planning and preparation.

“Are you sure? You have a positive ID?” A raspy, stark voice crackled in response. 

“Yes, well no. I just know. You’re gonna have to trust my instinct on this one. Going dark, I’ll see you at the point.” Celine asserted. She clicked off the analog radio and peered out towards her mark. They were hunting a drug dealer, one that was known to be affiliated with corrupt cops. Celine hated policemen that worked on both sides of the line, and she hated people that could stomach working with them even more.

She was crammed in a two by two foot backroom in the rear of a mechanic’s shop. There was a single vertical window on the far end of the room, a foot in height and a few inches in diameter. There was no glass pane or screen. It was as if someone took a saw and decided to carve out a rectangle right in the center of the wall. It faced out to the street, and the bus stop she was scoping was dead center in the view.

It was a Sunday, so the shop was closed and empty. A little shimmying on the deadbolt and a reverse shell on the security had gotten her inside. The head mechanic had owed her a favor for helping smuggle in exotic parts, and she was collecting on that debt impromptu. As long as she didn’t touch anything, no one would be the wiser. She’d let him know next she saw him.

She shifted her weight in the closet, pressing against plastic containers filled with random, miscellaneous parts. A bag of metal bolts fell from the top of the pile and crashed into her head. 

Her irritation momentarily distracted from the task at hand. For just a brief moment as she massaged the sudden pain on her head, a faint smile cracked across Celine’s usually stern face. It wasn't humor but rather introspection that broke through; an internal dialogue that ran something akin to wondering how a lifetime dedicated to chasing shadows had led her into cramped spaces negotiating with gravity over loose screws. She imagined herself in another reality where days were spent under clear skies, not hidden in dusty corners—an odd daydream for someone so ingrained in shadow work. Then it all came back.

“Fuck! Who emptied the world’s largest junk drawer into this place!” She proclaimed under her breath, kicking the half opened bag of bolts that were now sprawled across the floor.

Back to the chase. She made sure she got a solid visual. He was tall and pale, with a thin frame poorly dressed in lavish yet tacky and tasteless attire. Everything hinted at new money he didn't quite know how to handle. Then the key accessory, a two-tone blacked out Rolex Submariner strapped around his left wrist. He wore it with the bezel on the bottom of his wrist, exactly how the description from her source described. This was the man.

She stepped out of the backroom, careful not to topple anymore of the haphazardly organized goods. In the workshop, Celine surveyed the clutter, evidence of the mechanic's disorganized mind. A faint smile tugged at the corner of her lips as she imagined his frantic search for an elusive 10mm socket, buried beneath an avalanche of rusty tools and greasy rags. 

Inside every mess there's an order visible only to its creator, she mused as each careful step reminded her not to make assumptions about disorder. The mixed scents of oil and metal filings always brought a peculiar comfort—it was similar enough to gun metal in battle or repair shops bustling with covert activity; familiar grounds where being inconspicuous meant survival. 

Walking across the garage, she was diligent to leave the place as she found it, lest she incur the wrath of a man whose curses could strip paint from a car. 

As Celine reached the middle of the shop’s main floor, she closed her eyes. One deep breath, then another, then another. Eyes open.

She turned her wrist up to her attention. On a cheap band made of plastic links was a digital Casio watch, one she picked up in some shop in Yuma years ago. She pressed the side button twice. Once activated the timer. The number five and two zeroes blinked back at her. The second click started the countdown.

Her pulse quickened as the digital countdown began, each flashing number a reminder of the gravity of her task. Celine took a deep breath, savoring the familiar scent of oil and gasoline that permeated the workshop. It was a smell that had become oddly comforting over the years, a reminder of the gritty reality that lay beneath the city's polished veneer.

Click-clack. One in the chamber. Glock 19 in her right hand. Finger on the trigger. 

As she moved silent and quick towards readiness—the readying of equipment like padding armor onto soul—weaved through lingering doubts held tightly within taught muscles engineered for strain but doomed for loneliness. The machinery hummed dismissive tunes, out of sync with the racing heartbeats that accompanied the digital countdown. Thoughts darted between old memories, etched as deeply as serial numbers on hidden bones, yet these were momentarily blinked away by generous eyelashes, refocusing attention on the mission ahead.

She covered the distance to the side door in a few paces, passing by a fleet of rare German and Italian vehicles under repair. Pulled open the t-bar door handle with her free hand.

Sunlight - bright, brutal, and blinding in her eyes. The Arizona sun never played nice. She backed up against the brick exterior wall adjacent to the door, careful to stay out of sight. Her heeled black military boots clacked against the concrete pavement as she inched towards the edge of the building, nearly scraping the bricks with her back. 

The landscape around her seemed drained of all except harsh tones; beige buildings, white hot concrete, a relentless sun overhead as if trying to burn away any transgression with its unyielding gaze. Even so, there were pockets where life stubbornly pushed through -- little tufts of green at the base of walls or in cracks on the pavement. Celine could feel every grainy texture beneath her boots and each dry breeze that slipped into gaps in her form-fitted clothing whispered secrets against her skin.

She rounded the corner. He was looking straight at her, not in expectation, rather out of coincidence. With a freshly lit cigarette in his hand and lighter in the other, his eyes widened in primal fear. 

Celine's eyes narrowed in response as she took in her mark's appearance, her disgust evident in the curl of her lip. His gaudy attire screamed of ill-gotten wealth, a garish display of excess that only served to highlight the emptiness within. She felt a pang of pity for the man, a mere pawn in a game he could never hope to understand, before steeling herself for the task at hand.

Celine advanced a step forward, pointing the barrel directly at his face. Two crackling pops echoed out bloody murder to the surrounding neighborhood. Flocks of birds took flight blocks away.

The gunshots seemed to hang in the air, the acrid smell of cordite mingling with the man's fear-tinged sweat to create a heady, metallic bouquet. By now, she had gotten used to the volume of a firearm discharge without any ear protection. The ringing, deafening tinnitus became a part of the background noise. 

As Celine approached, she could make out the look of abject terror etched onto his face, the eyes already beginning to glaze over. Part of her recoiled at the sight, the part that still clung to the vestiges of her humanity. But that part grew smaller and more distant with each pull of the trigger. She began to search the body.

Wallet, keys, and a transparent plastic bag filled with plastic pill containers. She left the phone, wasn’t worth the trouble being tracked on it. Finding places to stuff everything into her outfit, she quickly tucked everything into her clothing. She stood up and glanced back down at the cooling corpse. Then, although she didn’t have to, she also nicked the Rolex and cigarettes, and made off down the scorching sidewalk.

Chapter 02

“You know the worst part of a job like this?” Celine exclaimed, dabbing and scrubbing furiously at the sole of her right shoe. “The fucking blood.”

She was in the passenger seat of a Honda Civic, driving exactly the speed limit. Honda had gone out of business years ago, but their consumer base was convinced that their cars would run until the end of time. Yuri was one of those hardcore believers.

“Maybe watch where you step, or enjoy the new red bottom Loubitins you just got.” Yuri snickered, taking a left at a light. Celine gave up on cleaning and sat back defeated.

They were headed to an underground warehouse nicknamed “The Lounge” by its squatters, having established themselves as permanent residents over time. A meeting was set with an anarchist cell where Celine would exchange the newly stolen wallet and keys for a batch of clean nanopulses.

They were called the 602-Originals, or 602s for short. Put simply, these were not people to fuck with. The amount of blood they had spilled could paint the entire Phoenix area red twice over. Their main objectives are undermining and destroying corporations, especially those that sponsored The Fractal, which was a long story.

“Five out.” Yuri said. The street suddenly fell forward into a steep incline and they were traveling underground. The sunlight went from an overbearing presence to a trickle amongst the darkening asphalt. Soon they were completely under the city, with only a few sparse streetlights and the Honda’s headlights as guidance. The road straightened out and they were driving on level ground again. These were the Caves, an artificially dug underbelly where thousands of Phoenix citizens had either migrated or been displaced to.

“We’re here. Stay on your toes.” Yuri commanded. She pulled the Civic around the back of the warehouse, parallel parking next to an empty gas tanker. They both exited the car, Celine slamming the door much harder than Yuri.

“Careful with my doors bitch, you know there’s no more Honda parts going around anymore, at least not for cheap.” Yuri glared at Celine.

“Doors are meant to be closed hard, otherwise it's a shitty door.” Celine sneered. Yuri rolled her eyes. 

They entered through a loading bay guarded by two teenagers with AR-15s. Yuri commented on their fifty round magazines on the way in.

“Ahhhhhh! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!” A man bellowed across the empty warehouse. Usually there were dozens of people taking refuge in this building at any given moment, but it must have been cleared out earlier.

“How goes it, what’s brackin’ Klein?” Yuri responded enthusiastically. Klein stepped out of the darkness across the vast room, into the luminance of the arbitrarily mounted light bars on the ceiling. Clouds of dust kicked up every time his shoes touched the stained floor.

Klein was named after Calvin Klein, seriously. He had become obsessed with collecting and wearing Calvin Klein clothing since the brand was bought out a decade ago. It was an integral part of his personality, so much so that he decided to use it for his street name.

As Klein approached, his arms wide in exaggerated welcome, the air thickened with an electric tension, typical of dealings in the underworld of Phoenix Delta.

"We got what we agreed on?" Klein's voice dropped into a businesslike tone as he gestured towards Celine, who pulled the stolen wallet and keys from her jacket pocket, holding them up for Klein’s perusal.

"Got your goodies right here. But before the trade, we need assurance; these nanos are pristine, right? No surprises like last time," Celine pressed, emphasizing her demand with a pointed look. Klein’s face split into a sly grin.

"Always straight, C. You know I wouldn't play you dirty." He snapped his fingers, and a young man stepped from the shadows, handing Klein a small, metallic case. Klein clasped it and tossed it to Celine, who caught it deftly. Opening the case, she inspected the neat row of nanopulses—tiny, glimmering containers promising the greatest rush humanity had ever invented.

"All looks good," Celine stated, closing the case with a satisfying snap.

“The key, please,” Klein extended his hand. Suddenly, loud banging from the front of the warehouse interrupted the exchange. 

Everyone's heads turned towards the noise as the front doors burst open, revealing a squad of heavily armed police led by no other than the police chief, Omar Turner. Celine despised that man with a fiery burning passion, he was the most corrupt member of the entire force, and he was at the top.

"Phoenix Police! We have a no knock warrant. Everyone drop your weapons and put your fucking hands up! Hands!" Turner barked, his pistol scanning the room as he barged in. SWAT members flooded in behind him, initiating their sweep of the room.

Chaos erupted. The two guards at the door suddenly opened fire, their bullets either sparking against the advancing riot shields or flying astray into the concrete walls. Klein grabbed Celine’s arm, pulling her towards a hidden exit at the back. Yuri followed closely behind.

“Move, now!” Klein shouted as chaos erupted, the clicks and snaps of gunfire ricocheting off the aged warehouse walls. With the adrenaline surging through their veins, the trio made their quick escape, weaving through machinery and piles of discarded techno-junk. They reached the back door, where Yuri took the lead out. She ran out to her car, the ignition roaring to life in an instant. Klein nervously paced and straightened out his blazer and t-shirt as Yuri maneuvered the Honda into position. The engine hummed low, its growl far more composed than their racing hearts.

Klein, Yuri, and Celine dove into the car—Klein in the back, Yuri driving, and Celine riding shotgun. Yuri didn't waste a second; her foot mashed the accelerator, and the Honda Civic lurched forward into the darkened labyrinth of the underground roads.

“That was too damn close,” Yuri muttered, her eyes scanning the rearview mirror.

Klein tossed a look over his shoulder towards the narrowing entrance of the warehouse, where the sound of continued gunfire echoed faintly. “Sick ride, Yuri. Got a connect with an R-Type, willing to sell if you’re looking to upgrade,” he joked, trying to cut the tension.

Yuri shook her head, barely turning to acknowledge Klein's words. "While that sounds amazing, we need to focus right now."

Celine frowned, her mind racing back to the night's earlier events. “He must have tracked me somehow from the hit earlier,” she said, her thoughts rushing like the speeding tunnels around them.

Fumbling through her pockets in desperation, Celine pulled out the Rolex. “This has got to be it.” The watch felt unusually heavy in her hand. Flipping it over, she popped open the backplate—sure enough, a tiny, sophisticated tracking device clung to the movement.

“Son of a bitch!” she hissed, tossing the watch out the window. The expensive timepiece shattered against the rocky walls of the tunnel, scattering into oblivion.

Back in the car, the level of stress was palpable. Klein, wide-eyed and trembling slightly, reached into his jacket. He retrieved a shiny silver nanopulse container and popped the pills into his mouth without hesitation.

“Now? Seriously!” Yuri exclaimed.

"Not exactly the time or place to take a dive Klein." Celine added.

Klein swallowed hard, his gaze firm. “Would you rather me be in withdrawal in this situation, or functional?”

Celine couldn't argue. Her own hands betrayed her; they shook with a fine tremor born from the day's anxieties. She knew she was an addict as much as him, but she tried to pride herself on appearing as clean and composed as possible. 

Reaching reluctantly for the case they had just traded for, she pulled out a nanopulse container, popped the top, and downed the pills in one swift motion.

Yuri’s eyes darted between Celine and then the rearview mirror. "You're both going to leave me to drive your unconscious asses around, alone in reality, in a getaway right now? For fuck's sake, I swear I'm going to dump both of you on the side of the road."

Klein’s and Celine's heads began to nod slightly as the pulses took effect. The intricate chemistry of the pills started their work, interfacing with the nanotechnology spread through their bloodstream. Illicit manufacturers had discovered how to lace traditional drugs into the pills, creating a synergistic euphoria that was nearly impossible to not redose. Heroin, cocaine, ecstacy, acid, except it literally takes your brain to another reality. Celine's formulation of choice was a mixture of benzodiazepines and amphetamine, with the nanopulse experience of floating through the clouds in the stratosphere.

At this point, Yuri might well have been talking to herself; their connection to the here-and-now was fading, their consciousness slipping into a chemically induced escapism.

The lights of the tunnel streaked past like meteor showers as Yuri navigated the turns and declines of the underground maze. In her ears, the only sounds were the hum of the engine and the soft, synchronized breathing of her companions, now lost to their nanopulse dreams.

When Celine and Klein eventually collapsed into their seats, Yuri grimaced. Escape, after all, wasn’t merely about evading those who pursued you. Sometimes, it was about keeping the mind sharp enough to stay one step ahead. Now as the weight of vigilance fell solely on her shoulders, she felt a mix of annoyance and worry.

“Just perfect,” she muttered into the cavernous dark, fingers tightening on the steering wheel. It seemed reality was hers alone to navigate tonight.
